<h3><em>"Spry as a jack-rabbit, yet he planted the 'ol oak grove?"</em></h3>

  How does the Dwarf Deer keep his youthful appearance?<br> 
  He doesn't. It is only an illusion, or more accurately, something like a mirage. 
  The Dwarf Deer's cave is backed up on a hot spring, causing intense heat and moisture
  to accumulate. This fog surround the creature in a protective veil long enough to slip by even the most astute trackers.

  Not only does it provide cover for the creature, it is said to create a Fata Morgana which can easily confuse and 
  confound a team wiping away any efficiency they may have built up.<br>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fata_Morgana_(mirage)">This</a> is what wikipedia has to say:<br>
  <em>Fata Morgana, the name of which comes from the Italian translation of Morgan le Fay, the fairy shapeshifting half-sister of King Arthur, 
  is a very complex superior mirage. It appears with alternations of compressed and stretched areas, erect images, and inverted images.</em>
