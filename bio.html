        How does the Dwarf Deer keep his youthful appearance?<br> 
        He doesn't. <br>It is merely an illusion, or more accurately - something akin to a mirage. 
        The Dwarf Deer's cave is backed up on a hot spring, causing intense heat and moisture
        to accumulate. This fog surround the creature in a protective veil long enough to slip by even the most astute trackers.
      <br>
      
        Not only does it provide cover for the creature, it is said to create a Fata Morgana which can easily confuse and 
        confound a team wiping away any efficiency they may have built up.

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fata_Morgana_(mirage)" class="fancy-link">This is what wikipedia has to say:</a><br>
        Fata Morgana, the name of which comes from the Italian translation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_le_Fay" class="fancy-link">Morgan le Fay</a>, the fairy shapeshifting half-sister of King Arthur, 
        is a very complex superior mirage. It appears with alternations of compressed and stretched areas, erect images, and inverted images.
